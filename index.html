      Northern red oak is a medium to large, variable deciduous tree [39,47]. It is the tallest and most rapidly growing of the oaks [20] and commonly reaches 65 to 98 feet (20-30 m) in height and 2 to 3 feet (61-91 m) in diameter [101]. On extremely favorable sites plants may grow to 160 feet (49 m) and up to 8 feet (2.4 m) in diameter [24]. Trees are tall, straight, and columnar with a large crown in forested stands but are characterized by a short bole and spreading crown in openings [101]. Plants generally have a strongly developed taproot and a network of deep, spreading laterals [47,56]. The gray to grayish-brown bark has shallow vertical furrows and low ridges and becomes checkered with age [39].

      Northern red oak is monoecious. Staminate catkins are borne in leaf axils of the previous year's growth, whereas pistillate catkins occur in two- to many-flowered spikes in the axils of leaves [101]. The acorns are approximately 0.8 to 1.3 inch (20-33 mm) in length, with a shallow, saucer-shaped cup [26,39,47]. Acorns are borne singly or in clusters of two to five [101]. The nut contains a large, white, bitter kernel [20]
